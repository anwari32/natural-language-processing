nucleoside analog acting innate immunity strengthens molecular basis therapeutic application broad-spectrum antiviral drug . nucleoside analog probably induce different subset isgs , least different

hel-specific ( fig ) memory yfp + b cell recovered ( fig b ) , correlate number antigen specific naïve b cell initially transferred . memory b cell defined functionally ability induce secondary igg antibody response upon secondary antigenic challenge . investigated whether subset aid/ yfp + igm + aid/yfp + igm -igg + antigen-experienced ( memory ) b cell persisting late time point could mount secondary igg response persist secondary transfer . purpose followed two different experimental strategy . first , x cell either igm + igm -igg + memory b cell , transferred excess helper otii cd + cell secondary rag-deficient host boosted ova-hel day cell transfer . absence immunization antibody level undetectable ( shown ) three week transfer recovery memory b cell subset - % initial cell input , exceeding naïve b cell recovery ( fig ) , supporting notion memory b cell may require specific ligand recognition survive ( ) . one exclude , however , cross-reactivity bcr transgene environmental antigen may allow signaling sufficient maintain naïve memory cell survival absence hel . following immunization , secondarily transferred aid/yfp + igm -igg + cell responded promptly exclusive production significant level hel-specific igg thus confirming memory statute ( ) . aid/yfp + igm + b cell response antigenic boost produced limited amount igm antibody ( fig b ) , little igg antibody , generate gl + b cell efficiently igg + memory b cell population ( fig ) . thus igm + subset may contain precursor able generate secondary germinal center reaction new progeny igg + effector ( ) . time antibody level decayed rapidly suggesting number transferred memory b cell declined secondary host antigenic boost . indeed , igm + igg + memory b cell failed expand week immunization cell recovery similar retrieval observed non-immunized host ( compare fig e ) . similar experimental condition , naïve b cell following immunization expanded , acquired aid/ yfp expression number doubled number initially injected ( fig f ) . data suggest significant fraction memory b cell generated reduced expansion capacity programmed rapid differentiation effector function . besides long-term survival memory b cell must maintain functional activity absence nominal antigen fully effective . test used alternative approach memory cell parked secondary rag-deficient host day re-immunization .

memory b cell subset belonging clone bearing high affinity bcr . overall observation support notion lymphocyte division rate life span intrinsic cell property , rather determined environment presence competing population . demonstrate upon correct condition memory b cell persist cell division . important question whether number memory b cell depends number initial naïve b cell . found , presence excess cell help , case . however , previously reported polyclonal response serum titer anti-hsa proportional number cell transferred irradiated mouse . possible limited antigen-specific t-b cell encounter may constraint number responding b cell thus determine linear precursor-progeny naïve memory b cell . finding indicate within single clone number precursor naive b cell present peripheral b cell pool determine neither intensity final number memory b cell response optimal dose antigen . suggest size memory b cell pool may controlled independently number naïve b cell precursor absence clonal competition memory niche filled single monoclonal population . considering diverse polyclonal population , limited niche memory cell imply strong competition among clone resulting selection best fit ( high affinity ) cell : rare mutated clone able compete frequent le avid clone . setting , transgenic memory b cell likely counter select new mutant clone since express high affinity bcr selected course secondary immune response . thus , notwithstanding expression aid proliferation detect bcr vh vl ig-chain nucleotide mutation among recovered memory b cell ( shown ) . finding may implication vaccination protocol indicate new antigenic exposure unrelated immunization would add extra competing clone supporting need repeated antigenic boost prevent memory b cell attrition . also demonstrate memory b cell pool reconstituted relatively small number antigen-specific cell . likely relatively poor memory b cell expansion observed immediate boost adoptive transfer could due lack rag-deficient host appropriate environment required memory b cell survival function . pointed b cell transfer transgenic ml rag-deficient host expressing low level hel resulted rapid cell loss recovery suggesting host , b cell trapped antigen location unable survive ( shown ) . nevertheless , shown b cell drive maturation follicular dendritic cell organization lymphoid follicle . similarly , transferred helper cell may also modify immediate environment . thus , allowing lymphocyte adapt modify immediate environment improved response important , recovered memory b cell pool size present original donor mouse . study show possible fully reconstitute primary response establishment antibody memory immune deficient mouse adoptive transfer antigen-specific monoclonal b cell together population monoclonal helper cell . indeed , generally believed immune deficiency , b cell therapy restricted application due intrinsic defect host 's lymphoid organ structure may prevent development immune response , germinal center formation , establishment antibody memory limit cell survival . contrast showed adoptive transfer immune deficient host antigen immunization induced b cell activation expansion , induction aid expression , class switch recombination , antigen-specific igm igg antibody production , germinal center formation generation two subset aid/yfp + igm + iggand aid/yfp + ig-m -igg + antigen-experienced b cell subset able persist lymphopenic environment cell division mimicking response obtained intact non-tg mouse . upon challenge aid/yfp + igm -igg + cell responded promptly production hel-specific igg aid/yfp + igm + b cell secreted limited amount igm antibody fail produce igg . contrast aid/yfp + igm + b cell could give rise new gl + b cell , suggesting full reconstitution memory b cell pool may require transfer different antigen-experienced b cell subset . importantly , found recall response efficient transferred memory cell given required time adapt new environment , suggesting period accommodation necessary transferred cell fully capable respond . finding also show different process modify survival condition memory b cell . finally , found generation memory b cell pool response optimal dose ag rely number initially responding b cell , suggesting autonomous homeostatic control naïve memory b cell property may allow reconstitution memory pool immune-deficient host using limited number precursor naïve b cell . autonomous control memory b cell pool antigenic exposure add new competing clone support notion vaccination strategy using

, ( iv ) host receptor availability sustained bacterial infection ( louria et al. , ; plotkowski et al. , ; cundell tuomanen , ; puchelle et al. , ; korteweg gu , ) . however , mouse model bacterial and/or viral infection several limitation . bacterial viral specie study human pathogen . recent year also shown host genetic variation sex difference impact predisposition , severity , outcome infection ( chella krishnan et al. , c bl/ balb/c mouse characterized higher resistance , dba/ strain susceptible permissive bacterial viral strain ( alymova et al. , ; chella krishnan et al. , . addition , transmission iav bacteria inefficient adult mouse , thus requiring alternative animal model , including neonatal mouse ferret ( diavatopoulos et al. , ; mccullers et al. , ) . iav shown essential pneumococcal transmission colonized mouse naive littermates transmission occurred mouse infected iav ( diavatopoulos et al. , ) . et al. , ) . ferret naturally susceptible iav isolated different specie , including human , bird , swine ( thangavel bouvier , ) . infection ferret human seasonal iav isolates result upper respiratory tract infection similar human influenza infection ( tripp tompkins , ) . contrast mouse , non-adapted human iav used infection . unfortunately , report bacterial iav co-infections model organism . report sanford ramsay showed enhanced staphylococcal colonization upper respiratory tract iav infected animal compared non-infected , difference group observed group b streptococcal infection ( sanford ramsay , ) . contrast , smith mc cullers reported lack establishment staphylococcal infection even ferret pre-infected iav ( smith mccullers , ) . biggest advantage using ferret model include ( ) susceptibility nonadapted human pathogen , ( ii ) efficiency transmitting iav bacteria one individual another , ( iii ) presentation clinical sign disease manifestation akin human influenza infection . unfortunately , limited availability , complex husbandry , limited accessibility ferret-specific reagent make research difficult perform ( bouvier lowen , ) . recent year , guinea pig ( cavia porcellus ) also used pneumonia research . physiology anatomy guinea pig lung resembles certain extent human lung model organism often used non-infectious lung disease , including asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( canning chou , ) . addition , commercial availability , ease husbandry , ability work nonadapted pathogen efficiency transmission reason using vivo model ( bouvier lowen , ) . guinea pig susceptible human , avian , swine influenza virus . although viral replication readily detected upon intranasal inoculation upper respiratory tract lung , guinea pig exhibit minor clinical symptom ( lowen et al. , ; gabbard et al. , ) . however , lung pathology human iav infected guinea pig correlate clinical severity human infection ( gabbard et al. , ) . transmission pneumococcus guinea pig promoted co-infection sendai virus ( saito et al. , ) . guinea pig infected pneumococcus alone cage-mated non-treated contact animal transmitted bacteria % case , sendai-virus infected , co-housed guinea pig acquired pneumococcal infection % contact ( saito et al. , ) . another study evaluated antibiotic efficacy invasive pulmonary infection caused penicillin resistant pneumococcus ( ponte et al. , ) . intratracheal instillation × cfu s. pneumoniae induced fatal pneumonia bacteremia % untreated animal within h ( ponte et al. , ) . ferret , paucity data describing immune response pulmonary infectious agent . part due lack specie specific reagent , disadvantage using model organism . recently , cotton rat ( sigmodon hispidus ) reported susceptible iav . nasal pulmonary infection adult inbred cotton rat require viral adaptation ( ottolini et al. , ) . infection led increased breathing rate accompanied weight loss decreased body temperature . replication iav extensive nasal tissue lung , persisted six consecutive day . tissue pathology included damage bronchiolar epithelium animal developed pneumonia persisted nearly week ( ottolini et al. , ) . bacteriological study rat frequently used . numerous rat model investigating impact diabetes ( oliveira et al. , ) , metabolic syndrome ( feng et al. , ) , cirrhosis , pharmaco-kinetics dynamic ( antonopoulou et al. , ; hoover et al. , ) , intoxication

unfortunately , study bacterial viral co-infections rat . first performed harford et al. , ( harford et al. , . author concluded secondary bacterial pneumonia convert sub-lethal viral infection lethal outcome ( harford et al. , ) . another study human respiratory syncytial virus s. pneumoniae revealed rat easily colonized pneumococcus , viral replication subsequent infection strain dependent . addition , neither pneumococcus virus spread upper lower respiratory tract , neither pathogen transmitted naive cage mate . although rat share lot immune feature human , including nitric oxide production macrophage ( carsillo et al. , ) , biggest disadvantage low animal availability , aggressiveness specie , lack specific reagent . rabbit ( oryctolagus cuniculus ) well known use studying cardiovascular disease , antibody production , eye research . rabbit also employed study pneumonia , although model available . typical read-out parameter include survival , leukocyte infiltration lung , lung pathology , assessment drug concentration serum . one first study pneumococcal pneumonia rabbit performed kline winternitz ( ) . study revealed rabbit posse active immunity recovered one attack experimental pneumonia may subsequently resist repeated intra-tracheal dosage pneumococcus ( kline winternitz , ) . infection inhalation type pneumococcus established rabbit ( stillman branch , ) . bacteria infiltrated easily lower respiratory tract pneumococcus reached lung usually disappeared within hour fatal septicemia appeared animal ( stillman branch , ) . recent rabbit model pneumococcal staphylococcal pneumonia based intra-bronchial intra-pulmonary infection make useful pathogenesis ( diep et al. , ( diep et al. , , , well drug efficiency efficacy study ( cabellos et al. , ; croisier-bertin et al. , ) . however , infection route requires surgery species-specific reagent scarce . iav research rabbit frequently used antibody production study antibody kinetics following single multiple iav administration ( loza-tulimowska et al. , ) . also , rabbit used safety investigation vaccine ( e.g. , covaccine ht aflunov ) ( heldens et al. , ; gasparini et al. , ) . recent year shedding avian iav cottontail ( sylvilagus spp . ) investigated revealing nasally orally inoculated cottontail shed relatively large quantity viral rna ( root et al. , ) . notably , low viral

zheng et al. , ) ; recommended patient chronic airway inflammatory disease receive annual influenza vaccination best mean prevent severe ifv induced exacerbation . another mechanism viral infection may use drive acute exacerbation induction vasodilation tight junction opening factor may increase rate infiltration . infection multitude respiratory virus cause disruption tight junction resulting increased rate viral infiltration . also increase chance allergen coming contact airway immune cell . example , ifv infection found induce oncostatin ( osm ) cause tight junction opening ( pothoven et al. , ; tian et al. , ) . similarly , rv rsv infection usually cause tight junction opening may also increase infiltration rate eosinophil thus worsening classical symptom chronic airway inflammatory disease ( sajjan et al. , ; kast et al. , ; kim et al. , ) . addition , expression vasodilating factor fluid homeostatic factor angiopoietin-like ( angptl ) bactericidal/permeabilityincreasing fold-containing family member ( bpifa ) also associated viral infection pneumonia development , may worsen inflammation lower airway akram et al. , ) . factor may serve target prevent viral-induced exacerbation management acute exacerbation chronic airway inflammatory disease . another recent area interest relationship asthma copd exacerbation association airway microbiome . development chronic airway inflammatory disease usually linked specific bacterial specie microbiome may thrive inflamed airway environment ( diver et al. , ) . event viral infection rv infection , effect induced virus may destabilize equilibrium microbiome present ( molyneaux et al. , ; kloepfer et al. , ; kloepfer et al. , ; jubinville et al. , ; van rijn et al. , ) . addition , viral infection may disrupt biofilm colony upper airway ( e.g. , streptococcus pneumoniae ) microbiome release lower airway worsening inflammation ( mark et al. , ; chao et al. , ) . moreover , viral infection may also alter nutrient profile airway release previously inaccessible nutrient alter bacterial growth ( siegel et al. , ; mallia et al. , ) . furthermore , destabilization compounded impaired bacterial immune response , either direct viral influence , use corticosteroid suppress exacerbation symptom ( singanayagam et al. , ( singanayagam et al. , , wang et al. , ;

still summarised follows : roosting tree ( hanging hole ) cave , flying , eating insect flying ( insectivorous bat ) /eating fruit tree ( fruit bat ) , flying back roosting tree cave ; biannual long-range migration nomadic movement specie . single bat cover large variety habitat even region migrating . therefore , transmission pathway bat animal urine , saliva , birthing fluid , placental

animal roosting feeding behaviour . majority study investigated potential infectious contact bat organism . novel technology , camera trap equipped nocturnal vision , could provide opportunity

relative importance . however , one prioritize transmission route based current knowledge . insect food-borne vector-borne route transmission need , surely , investigated , expose bat numerous host . previous work insect mainly concentrated sampling insect human outbreak ' surroundings ( e.g. , ) . searching maintenance host transmit ebov bat , protocol concentrate insect interaction known-exposed

explore direct , environmental , fruit-borne route transmission . behavioural ecology could inform help targeting protocol . chimpanzee monkey feed height bat . rodent specie feed fruit , selection arboricolous specie feeding height bat reduce list drastically . camera trap protocol could inform host interaction network placing bat specie symmetric asymmetric interaction potential alternative
